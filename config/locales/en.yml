  factoid_title: "Fuel for Thought"
  fact_1: "Each year, humankind adds six to eight billion tons of carbon to
    the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and destroying forest, pumping up
    the concentration of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming--an
    effect that could raise temperatures by three to ten degrees by the year
    2050."
  fact_2: "Each gallon of gas burned releases 22 pounds of carbon dioxide into
    the atmosphere. In a year, the average car emits five tons of carbon
    dioxide into the air."
  fact_3: "Romans not only gave us the modern drainage system and many of our
    roads, they were also among the first to use geothermal energy to heat
    houses."
  fact_4: "If it could be properly harnessed, enough sunlight falls on the
    earth in just one hour to meet world energy demands for a whole year!"
  fact_5: "Rainforests are being cut down at the rate of 100 acres per minute."
  fact_6: "One-third of the water used in most homes is flushed down
    the toilet."
  fact_7: "Recycling one glass bottle saves enough energy to light a 100-watt
    bulb for four hours."
  fact_8: "An aluminum can that is thrown away will still be a can 500 years
    from now."
  fact_9: "Every ton of recycled office paper saves 380 gallons of oil."
  fact_10: "Recycling one aluminum can saves an amount of energy equivalent
    to half that can filled with gasoline."
  fact_11: "Water is the most commonly used renewable energy resource,
    providing enough power to meet the needs of 28.3 million people."
  fact_12: "The largest wind turbine in the world, located in Hawaii,
    stands 20 stories tall and has blades the length of a football field."
  fact_13: "Using renewable energy technologies reduces pollution and
    greenhouse gases from the burning of limited fossil fuels."
  fact_14: "One wind turbine can produce enough electricity to power up to
    300 homes."

  solar_solution: "Energy from the sun can be converted into thermal or
    electrical energy. By taking advantage of the sun's rays, eco-friendly
    energy is produced and used for a variety of purposes."
  wind_solution: "By employing simple kinetic energy generated by wind
    currents, wind turbines are able to create clean electrical energy that
    does not produce emissions."
  hydro_solution: "Water movement can generate environmentally friendly
    electrical energy. Hydro energy is a renewable form of power generation
    and is a very effective method of converting energy into electricity.
    Hydro energy produces little or no greenhouse gas emissions."
  refrigeration_solution: "Advancement in refrigerant technologies have helped
    to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems.  Eco-friendly
    refrigerants are replacing ozone-depleting ones."
  biogas_solution: "Clean energy is generated by a gas produced from the
    biological breakdown of organic matter.  There are a variety of uses for
    biogas power, ranging from powering engines to running household
    appliances. Compressed biogas can be used like natural gas."
  intelligent_control_solution: "Sensors and software can be used to monitor
    and manage the use of non-eco-friendly systems, thus helping to increase
    energy efficiency and limit emissions.  Energy-consuming systems and
    emissions-producing appliances can be controlled automatically."
