  solar_solution: "Energy from the sun can be converted into thermal or
    electrical energy. By taking advantage of the sun's rays, eco-friendly
    energy is produced and used for a variety of purposes."
  wind_solution: "By employing simple kinetic energy generated by wind
    currents, wind turbines are able to create clean electrical energy that
    does not produce emissions."
  hydro_solution: "Water movement can generate environmentally friendly
    electrical energy. Hydro energy is a renewable form of power generation
    and is a very effective method of converting energy into electricity.
    Hydro energy produces little or no greenhouse gas emissions."
  refrigeration_solution: "Advancement in refrigerant technologies have helped
    to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems.  Eco-friendly
    refrigerants are replacing ozone-depleting ones."
